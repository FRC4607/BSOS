## Error Reports

If your build is failing and you want to see more information, check the build/reports folder. There you can find reports generated by checkstyle, pmd, and spotbugs. Just double click on the `.html` files to open them in your web browser. You should also check your console as error prone does not produce a report as well as to see which plugin is causing the build to fail.
